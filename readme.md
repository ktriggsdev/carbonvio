## About this project:

Carbonvio is a project created by a small team of developers looking to solve the problem of global warming, this project was created for the European Developer Week Hackathon running from 10th April 2023 - 27th April 2023

We are looking to provide the following features:

üë£ - Carbonvio will calculate your carbon footprint using a variety of factors including: **electric**, **gas**, **oil**, **vehicle mileage**, **flight duration (less than 4 hours)**, **flight duration (more than 4 hours)**, **whether your newspaper is recycled**, **whether your aluminium or tin is recycled**, and **how many trees you have planted**. later we hope to also add **cryptocurrency gas fees**, **nft gas fees**, **whether you eat meat**, and **food waste** as a future update.

üåç - Carbonvio will offer you ways to cut down on your global footprint and maybe even save you money in the process! **Save money, Save the planet!**

üöÄ - Carbonvio will rank your carbon footprint among many others, **the lower the carbon footprint, the higher you will be on the leaderboard. rocket your way to the top!**

ü•á - Carbonvio makes saving the planet fun by adding achievements and badges, such as achievements for **being a top ranking member on our leaderboard!** More achievements announced soon!
